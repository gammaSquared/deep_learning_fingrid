# Deep learning in the power market

This project is about applying deep learning to time series forecasting in a power market setting. The goal of the project is for me to pratice deep learning and try out different algorithms. In order to enable a GPU, Google Colab will be used. **To get started, go to the notebook called main.** 

The dataset will come from this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/nicholasjhana/energy-consumption-generation-prices-and-weather
